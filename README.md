# Software Design and Program Development
## Lab: Proof of Concept

In this lab you'll work on a proof of concept of a Java lab using the Codespaces and Github Classroom platforms. This lab will explore how well the Codespaces browser-based development will work for 1st year students, and how effectively we can use Github Classroom to manage and verify the correctness of student submissions.
